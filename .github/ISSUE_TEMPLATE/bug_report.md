**Unsupported distributions**
 - [ ] I'm *not* using [Ubuntu Trusty (14.04)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/private-ubuntu-30596045)

**Excessive usage of the repositories**
- [ ] I'm am not abusing the repositories to download excessive numbers of packages per day, or checking repository more than once an hour (like every minute) (see https://packages.sury.org/error403.html).

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

Please understand that this issue tracker is specifically meant to report issues with the packages and with the repositories. I won't teach you the basics of system administration, I won't help you with bugs in the software itself. For both, there are better sites where are people with more free time that allows them to be more friendly to newcomers.
